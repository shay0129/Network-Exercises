### SMTP Client, Server, and Protocol

**Overview**

SMTP Client and Server:

Created a basic SMTP client-server interaction for sending emails using Python sockets.
Developed SMTP_client.py for client-side email sending and SMTP_server.py for server-side email processing.
Defined constants and protocols in SMTP_protocol.py to standardize client-server communication.
Implemented authentication handling using the AUTH LOGIN method with base64-encoded credentials.

#### SMTP Client

**Overview**

The SMTP client (`SMTP_client.py`) is a simple Python script that facilitates sending emails via an SMTP server using the SMTP protocol. It establishes a connection to the server, performs authentication, and sends an email with predefined content.

**Features and Functionality**

- **SMTP Protocol Integration:**
  - Establishes a TCP socket connection with an SMTP server (`smtp.example.com` by default).
  - Communicates with the server using commands defined in `SMTP_protocol`.

- **Email Composition and Transmission:**
  - Constructs an email message with headers for sender, recipient, subject, and body.
  - Sends the email using commands such as `MAIL FROM`, `RCPT TO`, `DATA`, and `QUIT`.

- **Authentication Handling:**
  - Implements SMTP authentication using the `AUTH LOGIN` method with base64-encoded credentials.

**Commands and Functions**

- **Command Functions:**
  - **create_EHLO():** Creates the EHLO command to initiate communication with the server.
  - **create_AUTH_LOGIN_message():** Creates the AUTH LOGIN command to start the authentication process.
  - **create_USER_message(username):** Encodes and sends the client's username for authentication.
  - **create_PASSWORD_message(password):** Encodes and sends the client's password for authentication.
  - **create_MAIL_FROM_message(sender_email):** Creates the MAIL FROM command specifying the sender's email address.
  - **create_RCPT_TO_message(recipient_email):** Creates the RCPT TO command specifying the recipient's email address.
  - **create_DATA_message():** Creates the DATA command to start composing the email message.
  - **create_QUIT_message():** Creates the QUIT command to gracefully disconnect from the server.

- **Main Execution (`main()`):**
  - Connects to the SMTP server, performs EHLO and authentication.
  - Sends the email including headers and content.
  - Closes the connection gracefully after sending the email.

**Usage**

1. **Configuration:**
   - Modify `CLIENT_NAME`, `SERVER_NAME`, `username`, `password`, `sender_email`, `recipient_email`, and `EMAIL_TEXT` constants as per your SMTP server and email requirements.

2. **Execution:**
   - Run the script using Python (`python SMTP_client.py`).
   - Monitor console output for status messages and any errors encountered during connection, authentication, or email transmission.

**Dependencies**

- Requires Python 3.x.
- Uses `socket` for socket operations and `base64` for encoding credentials.

**Example**

Below is a basic example demonstrating the usage and configuration of the SMTP client:

```python
# Configure SMTP client constants
CLIENT_NAME = "client.net"
SERVER_NAME = "smtp.example.com"
username = "barbie"
password = "helloken"
sender_email = "sender@example.com"
recipient_email = "recipient@example.com"

# Email content
EMAIL_TEXT = """
From: sender@example.com\r\n
To: recipient@example.com\r\n
Subject: Test Email\r\n
\r\n
This is a test email.
"""

# Run the SMTP client
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

#### SMTP Server

**Overview**

The SMTP server (`SMTP_server.py`) is a basic implementation that requires client authentication to send emails. It listens for incoming connections, handles SMTP commands such as EHLO, AUTH LOGIN, MAIL FROM, RCPT TO, DATA, and QUIT, and interacts with clients based on the SMTP protocol defined in `SMTP_protocol.py`.

**Features and Functionality**

- **Server Initialization:**
  - Binds to IP address '0.0.0.0' and listens on the SMTP standard port (25).
  - Accepts incoming client connections and manages each client session asynchronously.

- **Command Handling Functions:**
  - **handle_SMTP_client(client_socket):** Manages client communication by interpreting SMTP commands, validating authentication, and processing email transmission requests.
  - **create_initial_response():** Sends an initial greeting when a client connects.
  - **create_EHLO_response(client_message):** Responds to the EHLO command with server details.
  - **create_AUTH_LOGIN_response():** Responds to the AUTH LOGIN command to initiate authentication.
  - **create_USER_response(username):** Validates and responds to the client's username submission.
  - **create_PASSWORD_response(username, password):** Validates and responds to the client's password submission.
  - **handle_MAIL_FROM(message):** Handles the MAIL FROM command to specify the sender's email address.
  - **handle_RCPT_TO(message):** Handles the RCPT TO command to specify the recipient's email address.
  - **handle_DATA(message, client_socket):** Handles the DATA command to receive and process email content.
  - **create_QUIT_response():** Responds to the QUIT command to gracefully close the connection with the client.

**Usage**

1. **Server Configuration:**
   - Update `SERVER_NAME` and `user_names` dictionary to configure server details and authentication credentials.

2. **Execution:**
   - Run the server script using Python (`python SMTP_server.py`).
   - Monitor console output for status messages, client connections, and any errors encountered during SMTP communication.

**Dependencies**

- Requires Python 3.x.
- Uses `socket` for socket operations and `base64` for encoding and decoding credentials.

**Example**

Below is a basic example demonstrating the usage and configuration of the SMTP server:

```python
# Configure SMTP server constants and user credentials
IP = "0.0.0.0"
SERVER_NAME = "SMTP_server.com"
user_names = {"shooki": "abcd1234", "barbie": "helloken"}

# Run the SMTP server
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

#### SMTP Protocol

**Overview**

`SMTP_protocol.py` defines constants and functions essential for implementing an SMTP client-server communication protocol. It facilitates email transmission using the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) by defining standard responses, authentication processes, and command handling.

**Constants**

- **Port Configuration:**
  - **PORT:** Standard SMTP port (Port 25) for sending emails.

- **Server Responses:**
  - **SMTP_SERVICE_READY:** Initial server response indicating SMTP service readiness (220).
  - **REQUESTED_ACTION_COMPLETED:** Successful completion of a requested action (250).
  - **COMMAND_SYNTAX_ERROR:** Error response for unrecognized commands (500).
  - **INCORRECT_AUTH:** Authentication failure response (535).
  - **ENTER_MESSAGE:** Response indicating readiness to receive email content (354).
  - **EMAIL_END:** String to terminate email content transmission (\r\n.\r\n).
  - **GOODBYE:** Closing connection response (221).

- **Authentication Negotiation:**
  - **AUTH_INPUT:** Request for username during authentication (334).
  - **AUTH_SUCCESS:** Successful authentication response (235).

**Functions**

- **Response Creation Functions:**
  - **create_initial_response():** Generates the initial server response upon client connection.
  - **create_EHLO_response(client_message):** Creates a response to the EHLO command from the client.
  - **create_AUTH_LOGIN_response():** Generates a response to the AUTH LOGIN command.
  - **create_USER_response(username):** Generates a response to the client's username submission.

  - **handle_MAIL_FROM(message):** Handles the MAIL FROM command from the client.
  - **handle_RCPT_TO(message):** Handles the RCPT TO command from the client.
  - **handle_DATA(message, client_socket):** Handles the DATA command and email content transmission.
  - **create_QUIT_response():** Generates a response to the QUIT command for client disconnection.

- **SMTP Client Integration:**
  - Provides constants and functions used by an SMTP client to interact with an SMTP server, ensuring adherence to SMTP protocol standards.
