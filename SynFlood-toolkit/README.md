# SYN Flood Attack Detection Exercise

## Objective

The primary goal of this exercise is to develop and test a Python script designed to detect SYN flood attacks from network traffic data stored in a PCAP file. The script performs the following tasks:

- Filters out IP addresses belonging to the attacked network to minimize false positives.
- Identifies potential attackers based on specific behaviors:
  - High volume of SYN packets within a short time frame.
  - Targeting specific ports (e.g., port 443).
  - Lack of corresponding SYN-ACK responses.
  - Multiple source IP addresses, which might indicate IP spoofing.
  - Possible retransmission of SYN packets.

## Instructions

### 1. Prepare Input Files

- **PCAP File**: Ensure the `SYNflood.pcapng` file is located in the same directory as the script.
- **Known Attackers List**: Create a text file named `attackersListFiltered.txt` with known attacker IP addresses, one IP address per line.

### 2. Extract Attacked Network IPs

- The script will automatically identify and extract IP addresses belonging to the attacked network, as defined in the `attacked_network_range` variable. These IPs will be saved to a file named `ips_in_attacked_network.txt`.

### 3. Run the Script

- Execute the script from your terminal with the command:
  ```bash
  python syn_script.py
  ```

### 4. Analyze the Output

- The script will print the following information to the terminal:
  - **Missing IP addresses**: List of known attackers not found in the PCAP file.
  - **Additional IP addresses**: List of potential new attackers detected in the PCAP file.
- The script will also save the detected attacker IP addresses to a file named `attackers_ips.txt`.

## How the Script Solves the Objective

The script detects SYN flood attacks by analyzing network traffic in a PCAP file. It follows these steps:

1. **Read and Parse PCAP Data**: Uses Scapy to load and interpret packet data.
2. **Filter Traffic**: Only considers packets destined for the attacked network.
3. **Count and Timestamp SYN Packets**: Records SYN packet counts and timestamps for each source IP.
4. **Identify Suspicious Behavior**:
   - Flags IPs with high SYN packet counts within a short time window.
   - Detects anomalies such as lack of SYN-ACK responses and excessive retransmissions.
5. **Compare and Report**: Compares detected IPs against a list of known attackers, reporting missing and additional IPs, and saves the results to a file.

This approach helps in identifying potential attackers by focusing on unusual SYN traffic patterns and response behaviors.

## How the Script Works

1. **PCAP Parsing**: The script uses the Scapy library to read and parse the PCAP file.
2. **Filtering**: It filters out packets not destined for the attacked network.
3. **SYN Packet Counting**: It counts SYN packets from each source IP address and logs their timestamps.
4. **Attacker Identification**: It analyzes the SYN packet data to identify potential attackers based on:
   - High SYN packet count exceeding a predefined threshold within a specific time window.
5. **Comparison and Output**: It compares detected attackers against the known attackers list and reports:
   - Missing IPs (known attackers not detected).
   - Additional IPs (new potential attackers).
   - Saves the final list of detected attackers to a text file named `attackers_ips.txt`.

## Key Indicators of a SYN Flood Attack

The script looks for the following indicators in the PCAP data:

- **High Volume of SYN Packets**: An unusually high number of SYN packets from a single IP address within a short time frame.
- **Targeted Ports**: SYN packets predominantly aimed at specific ports, such as port 443 (HTTPS).
- **Lack of SYN-ACK Responses**: Minimal or no SYN-ACK responses corresponding to the SYN packets.
- **Multiple Source IPs**: Presence of a variety of source IP addresses, which might suggest IP spoofing.
- **Retransmissions**: A high number of retransmitted SYN packets.

## Example

To run the script with default settings, place your files in the same directory and execute:

```bash
python syn_script.py
```

The output will include lists of missing and additional IP addresses, and a file `attackers_ips.txt` containing detected attackers.

## Notes

- Ensure that you have Scapy installed in your Python environment. You can install it using:
  ```bash
  pip install scapy
  ```
- Adjust the `syn_threshold`, `time_window`, and other parameters in the script as needed to fit your network environment and attack patterns.
