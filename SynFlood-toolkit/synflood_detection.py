"""
                    How the Script Solves the Objective

The script detects SYN flood attacks by analyzing network traffic in a PCAP file.

    It follows these steps:

1. Read and Parse PCAP Data: Uses Scapy to load and interpret packet data.

2. Filter Traffic: Only considers packets destined for the attacked network.

3. Count and Timestamp SYN Packets: Records SYN packet counts and timestamps for each source IP.

4. Identify Suspicious Behavior:
   - Flags IPs with high SYN packet counts within a short time window.
   - Detects anomalies such as lack of SYN-ACK responses and excessive retransmissions.

5. Compare and Report: Compares detected IPs against a list of known attackers, reporting missing and additional IPs, and saves the results to a file.

This approach helps in identifying potential attackers by focusing on unusual SYN traffic patterns and response behaviors.
